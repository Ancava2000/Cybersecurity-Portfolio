## Professional Resume

My name is Ana Carro Vázquez, and I am currently studying in the ```42 Málaga school cursus```. I have completed a degree in Criminology and a Master’s in Cybercrime, which provides me with a solid foundation to continue developing my skills in cybersecurity and programming. At 42, I am learning to program in C independently, as well as participating in the cybersecurity league and CTF competitions.

Furthermore, I am proactively continuing my education digitally. I have completed the ```Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course``` and ```Cisco’s Junior Cybersecurity Analyst course```, along with additional courses in Python and Bash automation, cyber intelligence, SQL, cloud computing, among others. My main goal is to work as a SOC Analyst, an ideal role for me as it requires communication skills, proactivity, adaptability, and ongoing learning.

In 2024, I intend to continue my training by working on more cybersecurity projects, completing the 42 cursus, developing my GitHub, and studying the ```SOC Analyst Path``` on Hack the Box.

## Portfolio Contents

This cybersecurity portfolio showcases a series of tasks and practical exercises completed during the Google Cybersecurity course. In this course, a variety of concepts were learned:
- Understand the importance of cybersecurity practices and their impact for organizations.
- Identify common risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as techniques to mitigate them.
- Protect networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access and cyberattacks using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.
- Gain hands-on experience with Python, Linux, and SQL.

Through this, I have acquired skills such as using Linux, Python Programming and SQL and learning how to use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and IDS tools. 

Finally, this course has prepared me to be able to work in entry-level positions such as:
- Cybersecurity analyst.
- Security analyst.
- Security operations center (SOC) analyst.
